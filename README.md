# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Next Steps/Further Implementation

Since the presentation was only five minutes, there simply wasn't enough time to fully show the power of Shopify Lab and what it can do for future entrepreneurs. When we were creating the concept, we thought about the pain points that entrepreneurs have when starting a business. The most prevalent issue was a lack of resources for funding (high upfront costs) and knowledge (the actual tools to build a successful business). So we suggest that you use this platform as the focal point of something bigger. Essentially the high level concept is a program that has mentors and a curriculum that can teach new entrepreneurs how to run a successful shopify/e-commerce business. Using this platform, you could create a modules with the sole purpose of teaching people critical skills like marketing, financing, hiring, market research and navigating Shopify's platform. The mentor's job is to provide their personal insight/experience to help these new entrepreneurs to navigate their potential business venture. In addition, the mentor should connect with the entrepreneur and motivate them to push their abilities and their business to new heights. This can be done through sprints which is a project where the business owners are under a tight deadline and have to complete a series of tasks that will propel their business to new heights. Now it is up to Shopify if they want to charge for this program however, at least in the beginning, this program could be a great tactic to funnel entrepreneurs in new markets to the platform sp a free or low cost option may be the best option. It may also be in Shopify's best interest to instead of charging, take a percentage of the revenue the business generates in exchange for access to the platform and the network of mentors. If we want to expand this idea even more, upon completion of the Shopify Lab program, they will get access to programs that can help them get funding for further expansion or network with investors to get advisors etc.
